## Descriptive Analytics on Mtcars Data Set

### Introduction

Using the mtcars dataset (which is pre-loaded in R, under the name mtcars).  This dataset was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models)

The purpose of this project was to write an R script to briefly summarize and present the qsec, wt and carb columns of this dataset, as it would appear in a paper.

The project will produce one figure summarizing the data in each column, and  report the correct descriptive statistics for each column. 


### Data Driven Questions

Below questions will be answered during the process of analysis

1. For wt in Mtcars Data set, use a boxplot to present the continuous data graphically, and calculate the median and range. 
2. For qsec in the Mtcars data set, use a histogram to present the continuous data graphically, and calculate the mean and standard deviation
3. For carb, use the table() function to generate the frequencies of cars with each number of carburettors, and produce a barplot to summarise the data from the table    you have generated graphically.
